# roblox-game-ai-backend


I tried to reproduce the GameArena paper (https://openreview.net/forum?id=SeQ8l8xo1r), with the code provided by the team: https://github.com/lmgame-org/ai-space-escape-engine and https://github.com/lmgame-org/ai-space-escape-roblox. We provide a simple version of the game that AI researchers can plug and play in their Roblox Studio and make minimal modifications to publish a Roblox game themselves. Please note this game is a starter template for AI researchers interested in building Roblox game benchmarks for embodied AI, to get familiar with Roblox game development. It is far from the actual AI space escape game in the GameArena paper, which features a more complicated Roblox game environment. Our game environment only has a single NPC.

## Part 1: Backend


## Part 2: Rojo Project


## Part 3. Roblox asset file
Bare minimal Roblox file that contains an AI NPC who can interact with the player to play three types of games defined in the backend: taboo, bluffing, and akinator. When a player wins or loses the game, the AI NPC will take appropriate actions.
