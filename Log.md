### 1. press E to start the chat interface


## 03/10/2025, Monday

### 3. improvement of current game engine

### 2. set up the github actions to setup the roblox game backend engine
first set up the roblox game backend engine service on AWS ECS

### 1. use AWS Route 53 for DNS management
Once propagation is complete, your domain will be using AWS Route 53 for DNS management while remaining registered with GoDaddy.
```
Connecting GoDaddy Domain to AWS Route 53 DNS
Here's a step-by-step guide to keep your domain registered with GoDaddy while using AWS Route 53 for DNS management:
In AWS Route 53:

Create a Hosted Zone:

Log into your AWS console
Go to Route 53 service
Click "Hosted zones" → "Create hosted zone"
Enter your domain name (e.g., example.com)
Select "Public hosted zone" for type
Click "Create"


Note the Route 53 Nameservers:

After creating the hosted zone, AWS will assign 4 nameservers
These will be listed in the NS record in the hosted zone details
They'll look like: ns-123.awsdns-12.com, ns-456.awsdns-34.net, etc.
Copy these nameservers (you'll need them for GoDaddy)


Set Up Your DNS Records in Route 53:

Add any DNS records you need (A records, CNAME, MX, etc.)
Click "Create record" and set up each record as needed



In GoDaddy:

Access DNS Management:

Log into your GoDaddy account
Go to "My Products"
Find your domain and click "DNS"


Update Nameservers:

Look for "Nameservers" section
Click "Change" or "Edit"
Select "I'll use my own nameservers"
Enter the 4 AWS Route 53 nameservers you copied earlier
Save changes



After Changes:

DNS propagation can take 24-48 hours to complete worldwide
During this time, some users might see the old DNS settings while others see the new ones
You can check propagation using tools like whatsmydns.net

Once propagation is complete, your domain will be using AWS Route 53 for DNS management while remaining registered with GoDaddy.

ECS errors
```
On Apple Silicon (M1/M2) Macs, Docker builds images for the ARM architecture by default. If your AWS Fargate environment is running x86_64 (Intel/AMD) under the hood, trying to run an ARM-based image leads to exec format error.

Conversely, if you build an x86 image but try to run it on an ARM-based environment (less common on Fargate), you’d get the same error. However, most Fargate tasks default to x86_64 unless you specifically configure Graviton/ARM.

2. Create (or Use) an ECS Cluster
If you don’t already have an ECS cluster set up for Fargate:

Go to Amazon ECS in the AWS console.
Click Clusters → Create Cluster → Networking Only (Fargate).
Give it a name (e.g., fargate-cluster) and follow the prompts.
3. Create an ECS Task Definition for Fargate
A. Through the AWS Console
Go to Amazon ECS → Task Definitions → Create new Task Definition.
Select Fargate as the launch type.
Name your task definition (e.g., ai-space-escape-engine-backend-task).
Choose your Task Role if you need AWS permissions (e.g., reading from S3). Otherwise, leave it default.
For Task Size, pick the CPU and memory that fits your app’s needs.
Add Container Definition
Click Add container.
Container name: ai-space-escape-engine-backend (or anything you like).
Image: The URI to your ECR image, e.g.:
php-template
Copy
<AWS_ACCOUNT_ID>.dkr.ecr.<REGION>.amazonaws.com/ai-space-escape-engine-backend:latest
Port mappings: Set container port to 8500 if that’s what your app listens on.
Environment:
You can add environment variables as key-value pairs right here. For example:
ini
Copy
DB_USER = mydbuser
DB_PASSWORD = secretpassword
For secrets, use Add secrets to reference AWS Secrets Manager or Parameter Store. For example:
ruby
Copy
Name: DB_PASSWORD
Value from: arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-east-1:123456789012:secret:my-db-password
Click Add.
Finalize the Task Definition with the rest of your settings, then Create it.
B. Using AWS Secrets Manager (Recommended for Sensitive Data)
Store your secrets in AWS Secrets Manager (or Parameter Store). For example, store ANTHROPIC_API_KEY or database credentials.
Copy the ARN of the secret.
In the ECS Task Definition’s container definition, under Secrets, add an entry:
Name: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY (this is how it appears in the container)
Value From: arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-east-1:123456789012:secret:my-secret-key-XYZ
Your container will see ANTHROPIC_API_KEY as an environment variable at runtime.

4. Run Your Task or Create an ECS Service
Run a one-off task
In the ECS Console, go to Tasks → Run new task.
Select your cluster, task definition, launch type (Fargate).
Configure networking (e.g., choose a VPC and subnets).
Click Run Task.
Create a service
If you want your container to stay running (like a web service), go to Services → Create:
Launch type: Fargate
Task definition: Choose the one you just created
Cluster: The one you created (e.g., fargate-cluster)
Service name: e.g., ai-space-escape-engine-service
Desired tasks: How many copies of your container you want
Network configuration: Select a VPC, subnets, and security group. Expose port 8500 if needed.
Then Create Service. ECS will spin up your container on Fargate with the environment variables/secrets you defined.
```


```
I now see the error messages in your updated logs, and it appears the deployment failed after the build completed. The error messages are:
Copy16:17:45.830  Failed to process build result for "src/serve.py". Data: {"type":"Lambda"}.
16:17:45.841  Error: data is too long
This is likely not directly related to having too many dependencies in your requirements.txt file, but rather to Vercel's Lambda deployment limitations. Vercel deploys serverless functions (Lambda), and there's a size limit for these functions.
The error "data is too long" suggests that your built application exceeds Vercel's size limits for Lambda functions. This can happen when:

Your application code + dependencies combined are too large
You might have large assets or models included in your deployment package
The AI components of your Roblox backend might include substantial libraries or models

For AWS Lambda (which Vercel uses), there's a deployment package size limit of 50MB for direct uploads and 250MB for layers, but Vercel might have stricter limits.
Moving to AWS Fargate as you mentioned would be a good solution since Fargate is container-based and doesn't have the same size limitations as Lambda functions. Fargate would be better suited for larger applications, especially those with extensive dependencies or ML models.

```
Option 1: AWS RDS (Relational Database Service)
This is the most robust enterprise solution:

Migrate your schema and data to a PostgreSQL or MySQL database on RDS:

Create an RDS instance of PostgreSQL or MySQL
Use a migration tool like SQLAlchemy-Migrate or Alembic to convert your SQLite schema
Import your data to the new database


Update your connection string:
pythonCopy# Instead of SQLite connection:
SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL = "postgresql://username:password@your-rds-endpoint:5432/dbname"
# or 
SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL = "mysql+pymysql://username:password@your-rds-endpoint:3306/dbname"
```
